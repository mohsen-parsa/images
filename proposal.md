Khadhar Team has great enjoyment in submitting a proposal to the Public health care (PHC) projects. We have a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in each area critical to the success of PHC domain. We implemented like this clinic management system for Hakimol Bironi Clinic and we have skill in areas reception accounting, drug store management, laboratory, operation and surgery room’s management with all aspects of requirements and crisis in PHC domain. We have clear understanding of the requirement set out by official and governmental with international standards, restrictions and rules. For our full team expertise and background please refer to URL that mentioned on the top of proposal.

## Qods clinic requirements##

<p>According to our experience in public health care domain, clinic, and interview that we had with Mr. Saedi and visiting from Qods clinic. Khadhra team understood the requirements to be as such:<br/>

<ol>
<b><li>Data reporting and analyzing</li>
<li>Calculating incomes and Budget reporting</li>
<li>Stock and expenditure report</li>
<li>Laboratory  testing results</li>
<li>Patients information report</li>
<li>Lack of using database and back up from information</li>
<li>Operation room data report</li>
</b>
</ol>
<p/>

<p>
Our proposed management system and design is such that it will give the report of all patients, patient services, making decision and solution of your daily problem, such us better services to people,  and also  stock reporting link, getting information about your everyday drug sales ,visited doctors , descriptions, personnel reporting, Operation treatments,  patients payment, drug repository reporting in time scale of  daily , monthly , yearly reporting. On the other hand also laboratory reporting give the information like result reporting and time of report. In patients information you are able to get the all information about your patients including dates and times he/she arrived. It’s also capable of securing by restricting access to the data in your database. In operation treatment, the software gives description of your Operations, available rooms, which doctor is in charge, patient’s payment and what kind of operation they had at what time.

## Software subsystems: ##
<p>
![subsystems](https://github.com/mohsen-parsa/images/blob/master/subsystems.png?raw=true)
<p/>
<p>
We divide the system in six, each subsystem divide to some other components. At first the reception phase is necessary because, it is like a core and we register the patients and save information about them. Print the recipe for patient and calculate incoming costs. The second subsystem is drug store and store, we can save about buying of new drugs, when they sold the system will report that how many of the drug was sold and calculate the incoming and other expenditures. The third subsystem which is laboratory the software will register the patients and save the information of patient’s test and give a result sheet as output. In operation subsystem which is the fourth subsystem, the software will manage the operation room’s scheduling and reporting like information about the price of room and kind of operation and doctor who was in charge of operation in database and calculate the cost and percentage of doctor and clinic and parturition subsystem are the same as operation room.  Office subsystem, in this subsystem we can manage the personals and their salaries and total incoming of clinic.By availing itself of our proposed management system and design, **Qods** clinic will:
<ol>
<b><li>Secure data storing</li>
<li>Data reporting and analyzing</li>
<li>Ease of work</li>
<li>Maintenance support</li>
<li>Reliable database</li>
<li>Time saving</li>
<li>Better management</li>
<li>fast Searching capability</li>
<li>Patient satisfaction</li>
<li>Ease of use </li>
</b>
</ol>

## Project cost estimation: 
<p>
>The following cost summary has been developed as estimation associated with the proposed solution. Based on acceptance of this proposal, our team will work with you to develop a detailed list of requirements, develop your tailored solution, and provide a more focused and applicable cost certainty.
As mentioned we have four system in this software package and in each subsystem we need experts mentioned in below tables and their salary so we need 3600 $ per each phase that totally it become 21600 $ to finish the project in expected timeline.
